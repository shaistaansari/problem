# problem
### This is a web crawling app that extracts data from a website and stores it in json file
### The web site is http://bgp.he.net/report/world and the testcrawl.py goes into to this website and extracts all the country names. Test3.py goes into the second page http://bgp.he.net/country/US which has asn's for one country i.e US and extracts all the asn numbers from that page.
### You can clone this repo using git clone command and run the test3.py which stores data in savedata file
### Testcrawl.py is called inside the test3.py but it can be run independently just to get the country codes
